# Castles And Anglers
    A text-based Python 3 roleplaying game.

## Actions You Can Take Anytime
    - show health
    - heal up
    - travel away
    - show inventory
    - quit

## Places You Can Go
    - the woods
    - the river
    - home
    - the castle
    - the market

## The Stack I'm Using and Why
    I started this project out on Python 3 in hopes that it would be good at parsing data efficiently and potentially including AI/ML in my NPC dialog down the road.
